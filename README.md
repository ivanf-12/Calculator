Calculator project for The Odin Project's course

### Things i learned
- Don't use id selector for CSS
- Differentiate css and js selectors (use data-... for js)
- Use objects and class to simplify js program
- Don't use too many "if" statements, improve the program if there's too many "if" statements
- Use switch statement if there's too many cases
- It's worth the time to think of a variable name carefully
- Remember to minimize the use of comments, if possible, make the variable name 'self-explanatory'
- Attaching both 'click' and 'Enter' event listener on button element, could cause a problem, better use div element
